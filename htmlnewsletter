	<h2> Now Accepting Applications for a Student Clerk </h2>
<p>Are you looking for more than just a job? Put your skills to work in a hub of the community as a Nevada Public Library Student Clerk! If you love interacting with people and you're great at noticing things that other people miss, this is the job for you. You'll help patrons by checking items in and out, assisting with finding library materials, and answering a variety of questions. You'll also get a first look at new library materials as you prep them for the shelves and you'll put away materials after they've been checked in. Shifts are after school until 8:00PM for one or two evenings a week and occasional day time hours on Saturdays.</p>

<p>Application forms are available at the library and on our website, and must be returned with a resume and cover letter by March 7, 2020.</p>
