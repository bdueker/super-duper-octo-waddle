	<h2> Now Accepting Applications for a Student Clerk </h2>
	<p>
		Are you looking for more than just a job? Put your skills to work in a hub of the
		community as a Nevada Public Library Student Clerk! If you love interacting with
		people and you're great at noticing things that other people miss, this is the job
		for you. You'll help patrons by checking items in and out, assisting with finding 
		library materials, and answering a variety of questions. You'll also get a first 
		look at new library materials as you prep them for the shelves and you'll put 
		away materials after they've been checked in. Shifts are after school until 8:00PM 
		for one or two evenings a week and occasional day time hours on Saturdays.
	</p>
	<p>
		Application forms are available at the library and on our 
		<a href= "https://www.nevada.lib.ia.us">website</a>, 
		and must be returned with a resume and cover letter by March 7, 2020.

	<h2> The Secret Origin of Comics</h2>
	<p><i>Wednesday, February 19 at 6:30 pm</i></p>
	<p>
		Learn all about comics! Dr. Zachary King, who received his PhD in English 
		Literature from the University of Iowa, will discuss the history of the 
		medium, how comics have evolved into what they are today, and just what the 
		heck a graphic novel is, anyway.  New to reading the format? Youâ€™ll leave 
		feeling like a pro, and with some great recommendations if you want to try 
		reading comics yourself.
